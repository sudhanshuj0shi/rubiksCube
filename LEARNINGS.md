# three.js Learnings

A running log of concepts I'm picking up while playing with three.js.
Add new entries at the bottom of each section. Keep notes short — link to docs when needed.

## Mental model

Think of three.js as a film production:

- **Scene** = the stage. It holds everything you can see (objects, lights).
- **Camera** = where the audience sits. Defines viewpoint and perspective.
- **Renderer** = the film crew. Each frame, it photographs the scene from the camera's angle and paints the result onto a `<canvas>`.
- **Mesh** = an actor on stage. It has a _shape_ (geometry) and a _costume_ (material).
- **Animation loop** = the projector running 60 frames per second — re-render, re-render, re-render.

---

### 2026-05-02 — Rotating cube, end to end

- **PerspectiveCamera(fov, aspect, near, far)** — the director picking a lens. FOV is how wide the shot is (75° feels natural, 30° is telephoto, 110° is fisheye), aspect must match the canvas or the actors look stretched, and near/far define the "in-focus" depth slab — the **frustum**. Anything outside that slab gets clipped; the actor literally vanishes.
- **Step back from the origin** — by default the camera sits at `(0, 0, 0)`, which is exactly where the cube spawns. You'd be _inside_ the actor's costume, seeing black. `camera.position.z = 3` is just buying a seat in row 3.
- **MeshBasicMaterial** — a flat-color costume that's its own light source: no shadows, no shading, just paint. The simplest costume on the rack — perfect for "is anything rendering?" sanity checks. Swap to `MeshStandardMaterial` later when the actor needs to react to real stage lights.
- **The render loop pattern** — the projector only advances if you ask it to. Inside `animate`, call `requestAnimationFrame(animate)` _first_ (so the loop perpetuates even if the body throws), then update state, then `renderer.render(scene, camera)`. Forget the render call and the projector spins but no film passes through — silent black screen.
- **Resize gotcha** — three.js caches the camera's lens math, so after changing `camera.aspect` on window resize you must call `camera.updateProjectionMatrix()`. Skip it and the audience keeps watching through the old lens — everything stretched. One of the most common "why does it look weird after I resize" bugs.

### 2026-05-02 — Outlining the cube: a fat-line story

> Goal: make the white cube look crisp with bold black edges.

- **Act 1 — ask for the silhouette: `EdgesGeometry`**
  - Like marking only the seams an audience can see — every cube face is secretly two triangles glued along a diagonal, but that hidden stitch isn't a "real" edge of the cube.
  - Outputs the **12 actual edges** (corners where two faces bend sharply), filtering out the in-face diagonals via an angle threshold (default 1°).
  - Hand it to `LineSegments` + `LineBasicMaterial` → crisp 1px black outline. ✓
- **Act 2 — wanting it bolder: `linewidth` is a lie**
  - Set `linewidth: 5` → nothing changes.
  - WebGL spec quirk: most graphics drivers (Mac/Windows Chrome) **silently ignore line widths > 1px**.
  - The prop survives in the API but does nothing. Plot twist!
- **Act 3 — the "fat lines" addon trio**
  - three.js fakes thick lines by drawing tiny **ribbons** (triangle strips) in screen space.
  - Three classes under `three/addons/lines/...`, named like the originals with a **2** appended:
    - `LineSegmentsGeometry` (populate via `new LineSegmentsGeometry().fromEdgesGeometry(edges)`)
    - `LineMaterial`
    - `LineSegments2`
  - Mental model: instead of a single thread, sew a **ribbon** along each edge.
- **Act 4 — the resolution requirement**
  - Fat lines measure thickness in **pixels**, so `LineMaterial` needs to know the canvas size.
  - Pass `resolution: new Vector2(width, height)` at construction.
  - **Also** update `edgesMaterial.resolution.set(...)` inside the resize handler — else the ribbon warps after the window resizes.

### 2026-05-02 — From a lone cube to a Rubik's troupe

> Goal: turn one actor into an ensemble of 27, and give them their own dressing room.

- **Act 1 — `THREE.Group` is a stage trolley**
  - One cube was easy; 27 cubes flying around the stage independently would be a nightmare to choreograph.
  - A `Group` is just a wheeled platform: park 27 cubies on it, and from then on the scene only sees _one_ actor. Rotate the trolley → everyone rotates together. Later, when we want to spin only the top slice, we'll build a smaller trolley and re-parent 9 cubies onto it.
- **Act 2 — the 3×3×3 grid, centered on the origin**
  - Coordinates `[-1, 0, 1]` for each axis = 27 slots, naturally symmetric around `(0, 0, 0)`. No off-by-one math, no manual centering.
  - Spacing = `CUBE_SIZE + GAP`. The gap is purely cosmetic — without it, neighboring faces fight over the same pixel (z-fighting) and you get an ugly shimmer.
- **Act 3 — share the costume, share the props**
  - One `BoxGeometry`, one `MeshBasicMaterial`, one fat-line `edgesGeometry`/`edgesMaterial` — passed to all 27 meshes.
  - Like 27 actors wearing the same uniform from the same wardrobe rack: the GPU only uploads the data once. Cloning per-cubie would multiply memory and draw setup for zero visual gain.
- **Act 4 — `src/cube.js` becomes a self-contained troupe**
  - `script.js` was getting crowded with stage hands. Extract to a module that exports `createRubiksCube()` and returns `{ group, onResize }`.
  - `group` is what the scene cares about. `onResize` is the **callback escape hatch** — the module owns its `LineMaterial` and knows it needs pixel dimensions, but it doesn't know about `window` events. The caller wires DOM → callback. Clean separation: the troupe handles its own makeup, the director handles the venue.
- _Gotcha:_ the Rubik's cube is ~3× wider than a single cubie, so the camera at `z = 3` was now sitting **inside** the assembly. Bumped to `z = 6` to step back into the audience seats again.

---

### 2026-05-02 — Painting the cube: stickers from a wardrobe rack

> Goal: give each face of the cube its real Rubik's color, but only on the _outside_.

- **Act 1 — one mesh, six costumes**
  - So far we'd been handing each cubie a single material — one paint can for the whole box. Turns out `THREE.Mesh` _also_ accepts an **array of 6 materials** when the geometry is a `BoxGeometry`: three.js has already split the box into 6 face groups internally, one per side.
  - Mental model: one actor, but the costume designer hands them a different shirt for each side they turn toward the audience.
- **Act 2 — the face-order contract (memorize this)**
  - The array order is **fixed**: `[+X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z]` → right, left, top, bottom, front, back.
  - Counterintuitive (most people guess "top first"), so it lives in the JSDoc on `getCubieMaterials`. Swap two entries and you get red on top — debugging that visually is its own special hell.
- **Act 3 — the grid pays off again**
  - Each cubie's position `(x, y, z)` with `{-1, 0, 1}` slots already encodes which sides it faces outward. `x === 1` means "this cubie sits on the right column of the cube" → its `+X` face shows red; everything else stays interior black.
  - Falls out for free: corners get 3 colors, edges 2, centers 1, hidden core 0. No special cases, no bookkeeping.
- **Act 4 — the wardrobe rack: 7 materials, not 162**
  - Naive instinct: build `27 × 6 = 162` materials. Actual need: **7** (one per direction + one interior black).
  - In `src/cubieMaterials.js`, `MATERIALS` is built once at **module-scope** — JS modules execute their top level exactly once on first import. Every `getCubieMaterials()` call afterwards just hands out references from the rack. Materials in three.js are pure paint; many cubies can wear the same red simultaneously without conflict.
- **Act 5 — a new module, a new boundary**
  - Color knowledge lives entirely inside `src/cubieMaterials.js`. `src/cube.js` gained **one import line**; `script.js` didn't change at all.
  - Future palette experiments (color-blind mode, win-state flash, accessibility tweaks) touch one file. The troupe handles its own makeup; the venue and director stay blissfully unaware.

### 2026-05-02 — Handing the camera to the audience

> Goal: let the user spin the cube themselves instead of watching it spin on autopilot.

- **Act 1 — `OrbitControls` is a phone-on-a-rubber-band rig**
  - The addon takes the camera and ties it (invisibly) to a target point in space — by default the origin, which is exactly where our cube sits. Drag = swing the rig around the pin; scroll = pull the rubber band shorter or longer; right-drag = move the pin itself (pan).
  - Lives in `three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js`. Same addon import shape as the fat-line trio.
- **Act 2 — controls need a camera and a DOM element**
  - Camera, because they mutate the audience's seat each frame. The canvas (`renderer.domElement`), because that's where mouse/touch events fire — listening on the canvas (not `window`) keeps unrelated UI from accidentally rotating the cube later.
  - Note: `controls` never gets added to the scene. There's nothing to render — it's a behavior bolted onto an existing camera.
- **Act 3 — damping = inertia, but only if you crank the projector**
  - `enableDamping = true` gives the camera a satisfying glide after you release the mouse, instead of a hard stop. `dampingFactor` is taste — `0.05` floaty, `0.08` snappy, `0.2` almost no glide.
  - The price: `controls.update()` **must** run every frame in the animate loop, _before_ `renderer.render(...)`. Skip it and the glide never gets computed — input feels jerky and stuck.
- **Act 4 — two rotations is one too many**
  - Auto-rotating the cube while the user can also orbit the camera is dizzying — both happen at once and it's hard to tell which is which. Pulled out the `rubiksCube.group.rotation += 0.01` lines so the cube stays still and the user owns the viewpoint.
- _Aha:_ `OrbitControls` rotates the **camera around the cube**, not the cube itself. Same visual effect from the audience's seat, but mechanically very different — and it's why the cube module didn't have to change a single line.

### 2026-05-02 — Turning the stage lights on

> Goal: stop the cube from looking like a cardboard cutout. Give it real plastic shading.

- **Act 1 — `MeshBasicMaterial` → `MeshStandardMaterial`**
  - Until now, every cubie wore a flat costume that was its own light source — the painted cardboard look. `MeshStandardMaterial` swaps that for a real actor: physically-based shading that reacts to whatever light hits it. The stickers now have lit and shadowed sides as you orbit.
  - The trade: the actor is invisible until you turn the lights on. Switch the material without adding lights and the cube goes pitch black — only the fat-line edges remain. Both changes belong in the same commit for that reason.
- **Act 2 — Two lights, two jobs**
  - `AmbientLight` = the house lights. Uniform, directionless, hits every face equally. Without it, surfaces facing away from the sun would render as pure black. With it, you set a baseline brightness for the whole scene.
  - `DirectionalLight` = the sun. Parallel rays from infinity, all traveling in the same direction. This is what gives the cube its lit / shadowed gradient and makes orbiting feel rewarding.
- **Act 3 — DirectionalLight's `position` is a direction, not a location**
  - For a directional light, `light.position` doesn't mean "the sun is over here at (5, 10, 7)". It means "the rays travel **from** (5, 10, 7) **toward** the target" (default origin). The light is conceptually infinitely far away — moving it twice as far doesn't change brightness.
  - Mental model: holding up a finger to the sun. The finger's direction relative to the sun is what casts the shadow, not how close you stand.
- **Act 4 — `roughness` is the matte/glossy knob**
  - PBR's two main appearance dials are `roughness` (1 = chalk, 0 = mirror) and `metalness` (1 = polished metal, 0 = plastic). For Rubik's stickers, `roughness: 0.4` gives real-plastic gloss without looking wet.
  - Interior faces stay at `roughness: 1` — fully matte. They're hidden inside the cube anyway, so spending compute on highlights nobody sees would be silly.
- _Aha:_ face **normals** do all the work silently. Every face on a `BoxGeometry` ships with a built-in arrow pointing outward; the renderer compares each normal to the light direction to decide brightness. Wrote zero normal code, got per-face shading for free — that's the gift PBR materials give you on top of vanilla geometry.

### 2026-05-03 — Spinning a slice: the turntable trick

> Goal: rotate one face of the cube without moving the other two-thirds — in a way that drag interaction can later drive frame-by-frame.

- **Act 1 — Why a pivot at all**
  - Naïve approach: rotate each of the 9 cubies individually. But `cubie.rotation.y += π/2` only spins each cubie _in place_ around its own center — they never move to new grid positions. To translate 9 cubies along a 90° arc you'd hand-compute every new `(x, y, z)` and orientation. Painful.
  - Real trick: build an invisible `THREE.Group` at the origin, parent the 9 cubies under it, then rotate the group. three.js does all the position + orientation math automatically because that's what parent–child transforms are _for_.
  - Mental model: an invisible turntable. Glue 9 actors to it, spin it 90°, peel them off again — each actor lands in their new spot, properly oriented.
- **Act 2 — `attach()` is `add()` with a memory**
  - Both methods change a child's parent. The difference is whether the world transform survives the move.
  - `parent.add(child)` keeps the local transform. World position can jump if parents differ.
  - `parent.attach(child)` recomputes the local transform so the world position **stays put**. Nothing visually budges.
  - Why it matters: after spinning the pivot, re-parenting cubies back to the cube group with `attach()` is what **bakes** the rotation into each cubie's permanent local position + quaternion. Use `add()` instead and the cubies snap back to their pre-rotation spots, undoing all the work.
- **Act 3 — Designing for drag from day one**
  - Two API shapes were on the table: a one-shot `rotateSlice(face, dir)`, or a lifecycle `beginRotation(face)` → `setAngle` → `end` that the caller drives. Picked the lifecycle as the foundation, with `rotateSlice` as a 5-line wrapper on top.
  - Why: drag is inherently continuous — pointer movement updates the angle frame by frame. A one-shot can't express partial state. Building the lifecycle now means animation, drag, and atomic moves all drop in later as different drivers of the **same engine**, no rewrite needed.
- **Act 4 — `snapAngle` and the 45° "click"**
  - `Math.round(radians / (π/2)) * (π/2)` — five operations of arithmetic that define the entire feel of a real Rubik's cube. Below 45°, the twist reverts to 0. Past 45°, it commits to ±90°.
  - That hard threshold is what makes a physical cube feel **decisive** instead of wobbly. Without it, half-finished twists would stick at whatever weird angle you let go at.
- _Aha:_ in the `SLICES` table, `slot` and `cwAngle` always carry **opposite signs** — slot `+1` pairs with `−π/2`, slot `−1` pairs with `+π/2`. That's "clockwise from outside" mirroring itself across each axis pair (right-hand rule under the hood). The table bakes the right sign per face so callers never have to think about it.

### 2026-05-03 — Picking actors out of the crowd

> Goal: figure out which cubie and which face the user just clicked on screen.

- **Act 1 — the screen as a porthole**
  - Every pixel is a tiny window from the audience into the stage. `THREE.Raycaster` shoots an invisible laser from the camera through one of those windows and asks each actor: "did this beam pass through you?"
  - Hits come back **sorted nearest-first**, so the visible face is always `[0]`. Anything farther was occluded — already invisible to the audience, no reason to consider it.
- **Act 2 — NDC, the universal stage coordinate**
  - three.js doesn't speak in pixels; it speaks in **N**ormalized **D**evice **C**oords (`-1` … `+1` on both axes, origin at canvas center). Two-line linear remap from `event.clientX/Y`.
  - **Y is flipped:** browsers count Y down from the top, NDC counts Y up from center. Forget the negation and clicking the top registers at the bottom. One-character bug, twenty-minute hunt.
- **Act 3 — local vs world normals**
  - Every triangle face on a `BoxGeometry` ships with an outward-pointing arrow (its **normal**). After a few twists, a cubie's local `+Y` arrow might point world-right — calling that face "U" would be a lie.
  - `face.normal.clone().transformDirection(cubie.matrixWorld)` re-aims the arrow to its current world direction — the only one that maps cleanly to a Rubik's letter. Always **clone** before transforming: `face.normal` is a shared geometry reference, mutating it silently breaks every future pick.
- **Act 4 — allocate once, reuse forever**
  - Pointer events fire many times per second during a drag. `new THREE.Raycaster()` and `new THREE.Vector2()` per event = garbage soup, frame-rate hiccups.
  - Hoist both to module scope; set their fields each event instead of newing up replacements. A canonical three.js perf footgun, called out in the docs.
- _Aha:_ the cube module already had `group.children`, but during a rotation that list temporarily holds the transient pivot too — wrong shape for picking. Exposed a separate flat `cubies` array of mesh references so the raycaster always sees exactly 27 things, regardless of what the scene graph is doing mid-twist.

---

### 2026-05-03 — Reading intent from a drag

> Goal: turn a 2D pointer drag into a specific slice + direction.

- **Act 1 — Two compass needles painted on each face**
  - Each face carries a "right" tangent (H) and "up" tangent (V) in world space. Project both to the screen once at gesture start, dot the user's drag against each, and the bigger absolute dot wins the rotation axis. Decompose-against-a-basis, done in screen space because that's where the user's hand lives.
  - Pre-projection happens **once per gesture** — orbit is disabled for the duration, so the camera (and the projected tangents) are frozen. Per-frame moves are then just two cheap dot products.
- **Act 2 — A gesture is a tennis rally, not a single event**
  - Three handlers (`pointerdown` / `pointermove` / `pointerup`) share one mutable `gesture` object with explicit phases: `PICKED` (hit but undecided) → `COMMITTED` (slice + direction frozen). Every handler gates on `pointerId` first — "is this rally even mine?"
  - `setPointerCapture` keeps the rally going when the cursor leaves the canvas. Without it, fast drags freeze mid-twist at the window edge.
- **Act 3 — Coexisting with OrbitControls**
  - Same canvas, two listeners. The world's smallest mode switch: `controls.enabled = false` on a successful pick, `= true` on release. Hit and miss cleanly partition who owns the event — orbit gets misses, picking gets hits.
- **Act 4 — Three signs collapse the cw/ccw question**
  - `dragSign * axisSign * slot < 0 ? 'cw' : 'ccw'` — three ±1 multiplications resolve every face × direction × slot combo. The math falls out of `cross(faceNormal, tangent)` baked into the `FACE_TANGENTS` table at module init.
  - Same "right-hand rule mirrored across pairs" pattern from last session's `SLICES` table. Trust the table-derived sign; don't re-derive it per face every time.
- _Aha:_ middle slices (`M`, `E`, `S` in standard notation) aren't modeled in `SLICES` yet — a click on the dead-center cubie of any face would try to twist around an axis with no slot at ±1. Detect early (`slot === 0 → return null`) and abort cleanly. Future-proof for when middle slices land.

---

### 2026-05-03 — Hand on the turntable

> Goal: feed the gesture's decision into the engine so the slice tracks the finger frame by frame.

- **Act 1 — One number drives the whole thing**
  - The bridge between "user dragged some pixels" and "slice has rotated some radians" is a single multiplication: `dragAlongTangent × sensitivity`. NDC drag → radians. No animation, no easing — the slice's angle is a pure function of how far the pointer has moved since pointerdown.
  - That's why drag-to-twist feels responsive: there's no smoothing layer between input and output. Pull back, the slice un-rotates. Reverse direction, it reverses with you.
- **Act 2 — Three lifecycle moments, three handlers**
  - `pointerdown`: stage the gesture (raycast + tangent projection).
  - First `pointermove` past threshold: `beginRotation(face)` — the engine wakes up, parents 9 cubies under a transient pivot.
  - Every subsequent `pointermove`: `session.setAngle(...)` — the only line that does any actual rotation.
  - `pointerup`: `session.end()` — engine snaps to the nearest 90° and **bakes** the rotation into each cubie's permanent local transform. Cube is now in a new "rest" state, ready for the next gesture.
- **Act 3 — Why the milestone collapsed to ~10 lines**
  - The engine was already designed for continuous angle changes (M1's `setAngle` instead of a one-shot `rotateBy90`).
  - The gesture had a phase enum precisely so it could outlive a single decision (M2b).
  - The decision helper already computed the chosen tangent + axisSign — just hadn't been returning them.
  - All the abstractions drawn earlier sat at the right boundaries; final wiring fell out as data plumbing, not new logic.
- _Aha:_ when milestones snap together this cleanly, it's a sign the earlier abstractions earned their keep. The "should this engine method be `rotateBy90` or `setAngle`?" question from the slice-rotation session looked like overengineering at the time. It paid for itself the moment drag interaction needed live updates with no rewrite.

---

### 2026-05-03 — All nine slices, no exceptions

> Goal: enable the three middle slices (M, E, S) so every legal Rubik's move is reachable by drag.

- **Act 1 — The slice table grows up**
  - Three rows added to `SLICES`: `M` (between L/R), `E` (between U/D), `S` (between F/B). Their `cwAngle` follows standard Rubik's convention — M mirrors L, E mirrors D, S mirrors F. Not arbitrary: it's the right-hand rule mirrored across each axis's chosen "guide" face.
  - The rotation engine itself needed **zero changes** — `Math.round(...) === slot` already handles `slot=0` cleanly (center cubies sit at world position 0). The pivot-and-bake mechanism is genuinely slice-agnostic.
- **Act 2 — A clever shortcut breaks; an honest one replaces it**
  - Old cw/ccw formula: `dragSign * axisSign * slot < 0`. Three ±1's collapsing into one branch — slick. But it leaned on `slot ≠ 0`. Slot=0 makes the product 0, which never satisfies `< 0`, so middle slices would have been misclassified silently.
  - New formula: `dragSign * axisSign === cwSign`. Compares the drag's rotation sign **directly** to the slice's cw sign, no slot multiplication. Same answer for outer slices (mathematically equivalent), correct answer for middle.
- **Act 3 — Tables carry intent, not tricks**
  - `SLICE_BY_AXIS_SLOT` went from `(axis, slot) → letter` to `(axis, slot) → { face, cwSign }`. Each slice's cw direction now sits next to its name instead of being implicit in a sign-multiplication trick.
  - Wider table, but any future code reading cw direction does it explicitly — no detective work, no re-importing `SLICES` from `cube.js`.
- _Aha:_ slick formulas that lean on side conditions ("slot is never 0") are short, but the moment the condition relaxes the formula lies silently. Better to write math whose correctness doesn't depend on a hidden assumption, even at a few extra characters. Especially when the assumption was holding back an entire class of behavior.

---

### 2026-05-03 — A cursor that knows what it can grab

- **Cursor as a stage whisper** — the OS cursor is the cheapest UI affordance there is. `'grab'` over a cubie + `'grabbing'` mid-drag tells the user "this is interactive" without a single label, tooltip, or instruction. One CSS string, infinite onboarding.
- **Hover = raycast on every move** — the same picker that runs on `pointerdown` (raycaster + 27 cubies) also runs on `pointermove` when no gesture is active. 27 bounding-box tests per move is essentially free; no throttling needed for scenes this size. The lesson: if a check is already cheap, don't pre-optimize it away.
- **Three cursor states tied to three lifecycle moments** — `pointermove` (idle): grab/none toggle. `pointerdown` (grabbed): force `'grabbing'`. `pointerup` (released): re-raycast and restore. The release case matters because pointer capture means the pointer might still be over the cube when the gesture ends — without re-checking, the cursor would stay frozen on `'grabbing'` until the user moved.
- _Aha:_ the same `pointerNdc` + `raycaster` instances drive both hover and drag. No parallel state to keep in sync — the cursor naturally agrees with what a click would do, because they share the picker. Reusing the picking primitive is what makes "hover state" a 5-line addition instead of a feature.

---

### 2026-05-04 — Taking the show on tour

> Goal: deploy the cube to GitHub Pages instead of just running it locally.

- **Dev server vs the open web** — `npm run dev` is a rehearsal hall: Vite quietly stands between your source and the browser, translating `import * as THREE from 'three'` into a real URL on the fly. GitHub Pages is opening night with no stagehand — it serves whatever bytes you push, verbatim. Bare specifiers that worked in dev throw `Failed to resolve module specifier "three"` the moment Vite isn't there to translate them.
- **`base` is the venue's address** — Vite emits asset URLs relative to its `base` config. For `<user>.github.io/repo/`, you need `base: '/repo/'` or every script/style tag points one floor up to `<user>.github.io/assets/...` and 404s. Five lines of config in `vite.config.js`, but it's the single most common Pages misconfig.
- **Recipe vs cake** — `vite.config.js`, `script.js`, `package.json` are the recipe — tracked in git. `dist/` is the cake — derived, regenerable, never committed to `main`. Two valid distribution paths: GitHub Actions bakes on every push (artifact, no branch), or the `gh-pages` package bakes locally and force-pushes to a `gh-pages` branch. Either way `main` stays clean.
- _Aha:_ the bare-specifier error is doing you a favor — it's the browser screaming "I am not a Node-style module resolver." That single sentence explains 90% of "works locally, broken in prod" bundler issues: dev tooling pretends bare imports are real URLs, production doesn't.

---

### 2026-05-04 — Hiring a robot stagehand

> Goal: let GitHub build and publish the cube on every push, instead of running `npm run build` by hand.

- **GitHub Actions = robot stagehand** — a YAML file in `.github/workflows/` is a script the robot follows. On the trigger you specify (`on: push: branches: [main]`), GitHub spins up a fresh Linux VM, runs the steps in order, hands the result to wherever you tell it (Pages, in this case), and discards the VM. Same job every time, no human in the loop.
- **Declarative pipelines** — you don't write "how to deploy"; you list the steps and let the runner orchestrate them. Each step is either a built-in action (`actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4`) or a shell command. The version pin (`@v4`) matters: without it, GitHub refuses to run, or worse, silently breaks when the action publishes a major version.
- **`npm ci` vs `npm install` in CI** — `ci` reads `package-lock.json` strictly and fails loud if anything's drifted. That's exactly what you want on a build machine: deterministic installs, no surprise version bumps mid-build. Rule of thumb: `install` for humans, `ci` for robots.
- **Permissions are a tiny security model** — workflows get minimal default permissions. Pages deploys need three scopes: `contents: read` (clone the repo), `pages: write` (publish), and `id-token: write` (OIDC handshake proves the deploy is from your repo, not a fork). Forget any one and the deploy fails with the unhelpful `Resource not accessible by integration`.
- _Aha:_ the workflow is the *recipe* for the cake; GitHub Actions is the *kitchen* that bakes it on demand. Pages is the *display case* on the street. Three roles, cleanly separated — and exactly the same source files (the recipe) flow through all three. Once you see the split, "how do I deploy?" stops being a separate question from "how do I build?" — the answer is "tell the kitchen to follow the recipe."
